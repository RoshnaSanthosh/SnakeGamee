## 📌 Project Description
This is a **multiplayer snake game** built using Python and Pygame. The game allows **two players** to control separate snakes, collect food, and compete for the highest score while avoiding collisions with themselves and each other.

### 🛑 Problem Statement
Traditional snake games are **single-player** experiences, limiting the fun and competition.

### 💡 Our Solution
We modified the game to support **two players**, making it more engaging and competitive.
