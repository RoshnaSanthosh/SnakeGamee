### Project Description
A **multiplayer snake game** built using Python and Pygame. Players control their snakes, collect food, and compete for the highest score while avoiding collisions with themselves and each other.

### The Problem Statement
Traditional snake games are **single-player**, limiting the fun and competition.

### The Solution
We modified the game to support **two players**, making it more engaging and competitive.
